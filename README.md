# hello-world

"hello-world" is my first GitHub project, it's in fact a tutorial project from GitHub.
"Hi everyone, My name is David and i am a passionate minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the Saving power of God unto salvation to every man who believes Romans 1 vs 16."
"I am also passionate about Computers, how they work and what gives them the ability to perform the tasks they perform, and thus due to my curiosity i am currently studying and training myself in the Craft of Software Development. I am currently studying at APTECH COMPUTER INSTITUTE."
"I am currently (as at when i wrote this) well versed i would say in the first part(HTML and CSS) of Frontend development, i guess you can call me a junior developer?"
"I think that is about all you should know about me, and least i forget "There is no other name in Heaven above or in Earth below by which man can be saved, except by the name of Jesus" (ACT 4 VS 12)
